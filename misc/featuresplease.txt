1. Physics and Math
2. Readability, from a physicist / mathemetician perspective
3. uh
This means use conventional notation when possible
Use english otherwise
Prioritize notational correctness over verbosity

variables:
x = 5 + y

Constants:
x := 5 + y

Complex Numbers:
1+1i, 4-3j, 7+3i+5j-5k

Complex Matrices:
Pretty self-explanatory

Units:
duh

Cardinality:
A = <1,2,5>
#A // <3>
B = <2,3; 4,5>
#B // <2,3>

Inner Products:
<a | b>

Functions:
function(a,b) -> {
	x = a*b
	<- 2 + x
}

Equations:
f(x,y) = x^2 / y
g(x) = {
	if x < 0
		<- 0
	else
		<- x^2
}

Algebra and calculus will only be considered if the function immediately evaluates without sideeffects. Piecewise is maybe. Accessing outside variables, or taking more than one step is not.
