Arrow means lazy evaluation.
every ArgList definition must be followed by an arrow.
equal sign means eager evaluation
if there is ever an arg list definition followed by =, it will throw if it is a named list. If not, it will evaluate the scope. If it is a vector of exactly that length, it will decompose the vector. If it cannot, error.
